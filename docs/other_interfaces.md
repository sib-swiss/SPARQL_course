# Other SPARQL interfaces

Here is a list of SPARQL endpoints - integrated in the ReconXKG RDF - that can be useful to query individually.

Note that they may rely on different RDF engines (i.e. GraphDB is not used everywhere).

The [Virtuoso](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/) engine is often used because it can manage larger amount of data, and is also freely available.
