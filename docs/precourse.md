There is nothing to prepare!

## Software

We will be mainly working on a remote [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) instance, [dedicated to Recon4IMD](https://reconx.vital-it.ch/).

Other SPARQL endpoints will also be used remotely.

You can, if you want, install GraphDB on your own computer, but it is not needed for the course. The GraphDB semantic graph database is available for most computers [here](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/). Fill the form (Select `GraphDB Free`) to access the GraphDB download links.
