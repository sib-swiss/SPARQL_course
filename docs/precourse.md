## Software

We will be mainly working on a remote [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) instance, [dedicated to Recon4IMD](https://reconx.vital-it.ch/).

Other SPARQL endpoints will also be used remotely.

You can, if you want, install GraphDB on your own computer. The GraphDB semantic graph database is available for most computers [here](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/). Fill the form (Select `GraphDB Free`) to access the GraphDB download links.
