## Software

We will be mainly working on a remote [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) instance, [dedicated to Recon4IMD](https://reconx.vital-it.ch/).

Other SPARQL endpoints will also be used remotely.

You can, if you want, install GraphDB on your own computer. The GraphDB semantic graph database is available for most computers [here](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/). Fill the form (Select `GraphDB Free`) to access the GraphDB download links.


TO REMOVE ?

Before the course, make sure you can comfortably work on a remote server. This means that you can approach it through the shell, modify scripts and transfer files. We can recommend `atom` for Linux and Mac, and `Notepad ++` in combination with MobaXterm for Windows. Therefore, install in your computer:

=== "MacOS/Linux"
    * SSH and scripting: [Atom](https://atom.io/) with packages like: [`terminus`](https://atom.io/packages/terminus) and [`ftp-remote-edit`](https://atom.io/packages/ftp-remote-edit)
    * Transferring files: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

=== "Windows"
    * SSH and scripting: [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ "get MobaXterm") and/or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) with the plugin `NppFTP`
    * Transferring files: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
