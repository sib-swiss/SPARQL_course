**After having completed this chapter you will be able to:**

- Understand the structure of a simple '`biological`' database encoded in turtle
- Write simple SELECT SPARQL queries


## Material

The exercises below follow the same structure as the [music exercises](/music/), with a focus on the GBA1 gene involved in the Gaucher disease.

Let's look at the [GBA1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P04062) entry in [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/):
